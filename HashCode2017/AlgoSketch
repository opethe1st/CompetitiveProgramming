Cache server - list with the sizes
    also have a seperate list with the videos stored in a cache server.
Endpoints - list of endpoints with the connected cache servers
    sort by latency.
    so [[5,3,2], [76,2,4]] means that endpoint zero is connected to cache
    server 5,3,2 and there are sorted by latency
sort requests by number of requests.
    put video in request (pick in order) in a cache server. Keep track of
    the cache server space. and also update a list with cache servers and 
    videos a cache server contains.
