# Codechef September 2020 Long Challenge Retro

This was an interesting contest and I am proud of my performance! My final position was 357!
I initially struggled with Find XOR before finally figuring it out. WHat made it so hard was
that it an interactive problem and I haven't built a test runner for such problems yet. (I
actually should). I also kept making small mistakes and I finally cracked it when I did the
maths on paper. I also struggled a bit with Chef and Trump cards but it turned out to be very
straightforward once you understand a bit of combinatorics.
I attempted Divide Candies and mostly gave up when I did some research and realised the general
problem is n complete.
